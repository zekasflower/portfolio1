        <p>Still those words from my brother not just a firend Abdulrahman is the most real facts that describe my character. (By the way he's looking for a <strong>Molecular Biology Scholarship</strong> if you can help contact him <a href="mailto:bla">Here</a>) </p>

        <blockquote>
          <q>
            I have a friend whose name is Abdullah. When somebody tells me that Abdullah is arrogant and has very bad traits, I totally disagree with that person as they do not know Abdullah well. From my perspective, Abdullah is a great person and has many amazing traits. For example, he is very sympathetic. As soon as I suffer from anything or have a problem with my family, he does not leave me alone. He always hurries to be beside me. When I had surgery in 2016, he was with me all the time. Also, Additionally, he is well-behaved. Even though he was very bright at high school, he was very modest with his friends. There were some clever students who made fun of other weak students, yet Abdullah was neither sarcastic nor arrogant. Moreover, Abdullah is incredibly thorough. He has been working as a web developer since 2019. When he works on developing a website, he does it with great attention to detail. As a result, if you want to have your website well-designed, he will be the most suitable developer to hire. His customers liked his designs a lot. Therefore, many of them hired him more than one time. Because they saw how he is very skillful and conscientious. Abdullah dreams to be a millionaire. I believe that he will reach his goal since he is very determined and nothing can stop him. 
            On a final note, Abdullah is the best person I have ever seen. I learned from him not only how to be self-sufficient, but also how to be resourceful. So, I consider him as a brother not only as a friend.
